                <p>Hello my name is <b>THE CLUB</b>, some know me as <i>THE CLUB</i> and others Memphis Hackclub. That being said, I am a mystic force that connects the most enthusiastic and creative minds together. When these minds come together, they speak prophecies of the future…And then they create it. I have distributed many posters, made many students into great programmers, and have allowed students to create the software of the future. I am a powerful force and I have too have an email if you dare speak to THE CLUB.</p>
