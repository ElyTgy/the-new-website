           <h1 class=welcome>What's a Hacker?</h1>
 
           <p>
Here a hacker is not someone who illegally breaks into bank accounts or steals your friends V bucks. Instead, here hackers are people who see problems that need to be solved and come up with the most effective and efficient way to solve these problems. Often these problems require an innovative mindset, technical skills, and exposure to new ideas. Many of these problems can be solved with computers or clever engineering. At Memphis hack club, we hope for our hackers to be innovative problems solvers and fluent in computer coding, problem solving, and engineering skills to solve hard problems. Before you say there are many problems that can be solved without computer coding or engineering, that is true, but coding fundamentally teaches how to solve problems. Coding teaches you how to break down problems and solve them, that is why learning coding is valuable no matter what career you choose. Our projects will be primarily coding and engineering focused, such as creating awesome pieces of software or amazing robots with Arduinos, and we have so many more ideas.
