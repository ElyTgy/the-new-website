  <h1 class="welcome">Our Past Projects</h1>

        
 
           <p>At Memphis Hackclub, we host weekly workshops and encourage our members to build on top of their individual workshops and create their unique version. Memphis Hackclub is a collection of talented student coders and engineers, and this page includes projects our members made in club and outside of club, on teams and individually. </p><br>
 
           <h1 class="welcome">Humble Beginnings</h1>
  
  <a href="images/humbelBegings.jpeg" target="_blank"><img class = "projectImgs"src = "images/humbelBegings.jpeg" height="100" width="180"></a>
           <p>Humble Beginnings is an indie game made in the 2021 Memphis Hackclub. The theme for the game jam was outliers, so the objective of Humble Beginnings is to survive in a foriegn world. The main protagonist is an alien who crashed landed on Earth and disguised as a human. The player must stay alive by collecting gas cans and get points by collecting coins. The player must also avoid being hit by cars or plastic bags.</p>

<h1 class="welcome">The Rabbit Hole Detector</h1>
  <a href="images/piechart.png" target="_blank"><img class = "projectImgs"src = "images/piechart.png" height="100" width="180"></a>
<p>The Rabbit Hole Detector is a Google Chrome extension developed during the Angel Hacks Hackathon by a team of Memphis Hackclubbers. The Rabbit Hole Detector was developed to make Chrome users more productive with time by visually showing them their website usage with pie charts. The extension stops people from going down a rabbit hole on certain websites by kicking them off after a period of time. These websites include know addictive websites such as Youtube, Twitter, and Tic Tok, but the extension also allows users to add their own websites and time periods.</p>

<h1 class="welcome">Bestern Western</h1>

<a href="images/rstart.png" target="_blank"><img class = "projectImgs" src = "images/rstart.png" height="100" width="180"></a>
<p>The Bestern Weastern is a Shooting gallery type game where you have to gun down crimales and spare the innocent. As the game progresses the timing gets faster and faster so you have to make split decisions to continue further. The Bestern Weastern challenges your reflexes and quick thinking to achieve a new high score, do you have what it takes?
